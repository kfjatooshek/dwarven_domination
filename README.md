I use this project to learn Python and software engineering, these are this project's main concepts These are the main goals I want to achieve during this project development:      
- better understand object-oriented programming - build classes, inherit them, etc.
- therefore reduce the code repeatability (DRY principle),
- separate the software logic from the hardcoded stuff :
- introduce code modularity, learn how to create modules, import them, etc.,
- learn how to use version control (GIT) and repositories such as GitHub,

  What's this project concept:
  - text-based game with a world inspired by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings
  - you can create your character with a chosen race, name, weapon, and armor,
  - characters can fight different types of enemies,
  - your goal is to defeat Sauron,
  - don't pick Elven race,
  
  Have fun!
