Mistakes i see i'm doing:
- pushing huge, chaotic commits, instead of smaller modifications for each push
- repeating myself, even though i know the DRY principle
- havent prepared the project stucture, possible classes and functions -
    i thought my head is capable enough to imagine all of this, keep it for days
    and was hoping this is good idea
- i want to see the effect of the program as fast as possible and I break the
    DRY rules (copied whole avatar.py logic to items.py)
- during the coding i come to new ideas on and on, want to implement them, delaying
    in fact the finishing of base program structure, I need to have a plan and
    stick to it by all means
- "i will fix the code later" - later means never. Keeping clean code is a matter of future survival
