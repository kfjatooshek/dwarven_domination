Engineering is:
•	tests
•	more tests
•	even more tests
•	documentation
•	design / architecture
•	reviewing other’s code
•	readability (not fancy clever things on leetcode)
•	logging
•	monitoring and associated stacks
•	etc

Git is a must (setup a GitHub account, set the main branch to protected, and practice creating your own PRs).
